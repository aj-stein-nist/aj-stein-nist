# About Me

Howdy, I am Alexander Stein. I go by A.J. because I am into the whole brevity thing.

I am an IT Cybersecurity Specialist in the [Secure Systems and Applications Group, part of ITL CSD](https://www.nist.gov/itl/csd/secure-systems-and-applications). Before that, I have worked in the commercial, defense, healthcare, higher education, and public (US government contracting) sectors.

I am not one for titles. I have always enjoyed "security stuffs" and look for projects where I can explore it. More and more, I focus on the intersection of software development and different disciplines in security (application, infrastructure, information, network, et cetera) and risk management.

## How to reach me: ...

My NIST email is the profile slug when you visit my account. You can also feel free open GitHub issues on any OSCAL or personal repo, and I will try to respond when I am able.

## I'm currently working on ...

Most of what I currently do is arund cyber-security data modeling, particularly for [OSCAL](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/about/). I encourage you to check it out.

## I'm currently learning ...

- Language and parser design
- Blockchain technologies
- A variety of other things.

I am doing something new and [learn in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/). Feel free to look at [`notebook`, my research repo](https://github.com/aj-stein-nist/notebook/blob/master/README.md) to read and learn more. Hold me accountable, open issues there if things are unclear, confusing, or you have ideas for related topics worth learning. :-)


## Iâ€™m looking for help with ...

If you are using OSCAL in some way in your work, the development team and I want your help. Let us know how we can add, change, or remove parts of OSCAL to help you with that work. I cannot guarantee we will just make the change, but I will listen with an open mind and work with you.

## Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...

OSCAL or not, I am excited to collaborate with people on anything.

## And the cat ...

That's Darcy. We both have our moods, and like I say: together we represent the continuum of emotions one feels in security and software development, from elated to dejected.
