# About

Howdy, I am Alexander Stein. I go by A.J. because I am into the whole brevity thing.

I am an IT Cybersecurity Specialist in 773.02, the [Security Components and Measurements Group, part of ITL CSD](https://www.nist.gov/itl/csd/security-components-and-mechanisms). Before that, I have worked in the commercial, defense, healthcare, higher education, and public (US government contracting) sectors. I am a proud 10x alum, so look into [10x and submit ideas if you're a federal employee](https://10x.gsa.gov/process/)! One of my 10x projects led me to OSCAL.

I am not one for titles. I have always enjoyed "security stuffs" and look for projects where I can explore it. More and more, I focus on the intersection of software development and different disciplines in security (application, infrastructure, information, network, et cetera) and risk management.

## Contact

My NIST email is the profile slug when you visit my account. You can also feel free open GitHub issues on any OSCAL or personal repo, and I will try to respond when I am able.

## Calendar

You can see a redacted version of my calendar in the two different formats in the list below. If it is blue, I am booked. Do not try to schedule me, or do not expect an urgent response during those time.

- [Web-friendly HTML version](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/553a60383771471381091ed979a954f6@nist.gov/fec1e6b5fd2545aa9fe7ff4267548ef37310489405368901641/calendar.html)
- [CalDAV ICS file, use this in your calendar app of choice, most support it](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/553a60383771471381091ed979a954f6@nist.gov/fec1e6b5fd2545aa9fe7ff4267548ef37310489405368901641/calendar.ics)

## Work

Most of what I currently do is around cyber-security data modeling, particularly for [OSCAL](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/about/). I encourage you to check it out.

## Study

- Language and parser design
- Blockchain technologies
- A variety of other things.

I am doing something new and [learn in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/). Feel free to look at [`notebook`, my research repo](https://github.com/aj-stein-nist/notebook/blob/master/README.md) to read and learn more. Hold me accountable, open issues there if things are unclear, confusing, or you have ideas for related topics worth learning. :-)


## Helping Me

If you are using OSCAL in some way in your work, the development team and I want your help. Let us know how we can add, change, or remove parts of OSCAL to help you with that work. I cannot guarantee we will just make the change, but I will listen with an open mind and work with you.

## Collaborating with Me

OSCAL or not, I am excited to collaborate with people on anything.

## Cat

That's Darcy. We both have our moods, and like I say: together we represent the continuum of emotions one feels in security and software development, from elated to dejected.
