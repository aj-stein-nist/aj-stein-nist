# About

Howdy, I am Alexander Stein. I go by A.J. because I am into the whole brevity thing.

I am an IT Cybersecurity Specialist in 773.02, the [Security Components and Measurements Group, part of ITL CSD](https://www.nist.gov/itl/csd/security-components-and-mechanisms). Before that, I have worked in the commercial, defense, healthcare, higher education, and public (US government contracting) sectors. I am a proud 10x alum, so look into [10x and submit ideas if you're a federal employee](https://10x.gsa.gov/process/)! One of my 10x projects led me to work with OSCAL and work on it full-time at NIST.

I engage in several voluntary SDOs (Standards Development Organizations), and I really enjoy my contributions to the Internet Engineering Task Force. You can find more information about my past and present contributions at IETF by [reviewing my profile page](https://datatracker.ietf.org/person/A.J.%20Stein).

I am not one for titles. I have always enjoyed "security stuffs" and look for projects where I can explore it. More and more, I focus on the intersection of software development and different disciplines in security (application, infrastructure, information, network, et cetera) and risk management.

## Calendar

You need to book time with me about my work or potential future collaboration? That's great, [book time with me by clicking this link](https://outlook.office.com/bookwithme/user/553a60383771471381091ed979a954f6@nist.gov?anonymous&ep=plink).

You can see a redacted version of my calendar in the two different formats in the list below. If it is blue, I am booked. Do not try to schedule me, or do not expect an urgent response during those time.

## Contact

My NIST email is the profile slug when you visit my account. You can also feel free open GitHub issues on any OSCAL or personal repo, and I will try to respond when I am able.

## Work

Most of what I currently do is around cyber-security data modeling. Looking for more detail? Check out [my GitHub project](https://github.com/users/aj-stein-nist/projects/3/views/1) and [repo](https://github.com/aj-stein-nist/okrs/) I use to track my day-to-day work across various projects.

## Study

- Measuring security practices in organizations across industry
- Increasing transparency with data sharing to help society trust data, software, and hardware safety and security claims
- Distributed ledger technologies
- Language and parser design

I am doing something new and [learn in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/). Feel free to look at [`notebook`, my research repo](https://github.com/aj-stein-nist/notebook/blob/master/README.md) to read and learn more. Hold me accountable, open issues there if things are unclear, confusing, or you have ideas for related topics worth learning. :-)


## Collaboration and Help

If you are using any of my projects (check [my GitHub activity](https://github.com/aj-stein-nist) or [public NIST profile](https://www.nist.gov/people/alexander-stein)) in your work, I want your help. Contact me via [email](mailto:aj@nist.gov), [Gitter/Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/@aj-stein-nist-619d4e9d6da03739848b2b5a:gitter.im), or [Mastodon](https://floss.social/@ajsteinnist), in order of preference.

## Cat

That's Darcy. We both have our moods, and like I say: together we represent the continuum of emotions one feels in security and software development, from elated to dejected.
